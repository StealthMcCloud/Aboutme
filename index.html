<h4><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h4><img class="img1" src="FANMADE_Twilight_read_poster.png"></div>
<p>My name is <strong>Clinton Patrick Johnson</strong> and I am currently <em>33 years old</em> (But I will be 34 in November). I have a love of learning and I really enjoy to play video games, watch My Little Pony or MLP for short and I really love to learn.  Learning new things is something that I have always enjoyed as it gives me a greater understanding of how things work.  I have many favorite video games but I would have to say any games from the RPG Genre tend to be my favorite of all of them.<br><br>
    
    I am more than happy to answer any questions that anyone may have about what I like as well.  My little pony is a show that was made for little girls and their families to watch together as stated by the shows creator Lauren Faust.  What many people didn't know however is how much the show would impact many peoples lives.  I am proud to say that the show has changed my way of thinking and that it has made me a much better person.<br><br>

    I also enjoy to read when I have the time.  I really enjoy reading the Fallout Equestria Books as these books tend to combine two of my favorite things into one.  My little Pony and Fallout.  It is a very interesting story with a lot of depth to the characters which has even caused it to spawn video games as well as other books.  I do enjoy other books as well such as the Eragon series, Harry Potter and even the Dragon Lance books.<br><br>

    Finally I am very open minded.  I am not one to judge anyone for what they like and I am even willing to give things a try if I haven't tried them before.  It also helps to give me a better understanding of the individual and will help me to get along with them better.  All in all I am a very happy open minded individual with a unique diversity of characteristics and I love to make friends.
